# urbanECG
This repo contains FARLAB's code and materials on ongoing work with the idea of 'urban fingerprinting' or 'urban heartbeat'. Here, we seek to identify how actors in urban environments change over space and time; specifically, we first focus on seeing how the volume of pedestrians, automotives, and bicyles is distributed over dimensions of space and time. We provide code to replicate our analysis or to serve as the backbone of spinoff work. 

This work is supported by Nexar Inc., who provides the anonymized dashboard camera image data that we work with.
